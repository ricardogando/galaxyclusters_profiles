# galaxyclusters_profiles

This script composes the work "Perfis de densidade de matéria de aglomerados de galáxias" developded during a year for the Programa de Iniciação Científica PIBIC 2019/2020 of the Universidade de Brasília (UnB).

In this code we implemented the density profile of dark matter halos and its logarithmic slope for different models existent in the literature, to be specific the Hernquist, NFW and Einasto profiles. For these models, we've also implemented other physical quantities which depend on the density profile, e.g., the surface mass density, average surface mass density and excess surface mass density. 

We choose those models once some properties of them can be expressed by analytical functions. We have even implemented a combination of them with a mean density outer profile. 

Whenever possible, we compared our code results with the ones using the Colossus library to check for precision and agreement.
